# Portofolio Template
A personal portofolio template insipired by @imfunniee and made by @e-coders.<br>
I have made this portofolio template in 2 hours with 10% Bootstrap and 90% self-code.<br>
Its easy to create your portofolio. Just download and extract the repo and open `js/script.js` and above `Website Configuration` fill the variables and lists as shown example. Immediately, when you again run index.html, the index.html will be updated as the script is linked.
